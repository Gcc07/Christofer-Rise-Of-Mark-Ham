# BLOCKERS

- We actually didn't experience Many blockers, development was pretty smooth.
- If anything, the time constraints of only having limited interacting with each other (During Class Periods) was the only hinter to development.
- A couple times, during our in class sessions LiveShare (Which we were using to collaborate on the code) stopped working on Troy's Computer.
- We solved this issue by just using the traditional gitHub pull request system. (He pulled the REPO to his computer directly)
- Other than that, we didn't really face any creative clashes or disagreements.
- Scope creep also might have been sort of an issue.
- Our solution to planning too much content was picking and choosing what to cut. In the end, we kept mostly everything.
- Perhaps our only code Blocker was the fact that you cannot iterate over a dictionary. Without knowing, we used dictionary instead of Map, (Looking for a solution to key-value needs)
- Not realising that Dictionary was sort of outdated. Our workaround was to just manually pull (get()) from the player stats in the useItem(Item item) method.
