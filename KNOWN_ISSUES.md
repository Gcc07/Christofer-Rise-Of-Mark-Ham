- Multiple issues with switch statements unintentionally bleeding into one another due to the lack of a break; (FIXED)
- Code reference was causing player to gain enemyHP as markpoints due to incorrect variable assignment (FIXED)
- Calculate max enemies logic allowed for an extra enemy in contrast to the provided max because >= was used instead of > (FIXED)
- If you flee on the final boss, (and possibly other enemies?) They will simply dissapear. (NOT FIXED)
